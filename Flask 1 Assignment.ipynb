    "Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight web framework written in Python. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, allowing developers to build web applications quickly without the overhead of more complex frameworks. Flask is considered a micro-framework because it does not come with built-in support for database handling, form validation, or other features often found in larger frameworks, but it can easily be extended with third-party libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight and flexible: Flask is simple and easy to use, allowing developers to build applications with less effort.\n",
    "Modular and Scalable: It allows developers to create smaller modules, making the application scalable.\n",
    "Built-in development server: Flask includes a built-in server for testing and debugging applications during development.\n",
    "Extensible: Flask allows easy integration with third-party libraries and extensions like SQLAlchemy (for database), Flask-WTF (for forms), and others.\n",
    "Minimalist: Unlike other frameworks like Django, Flask gives developers the flexibility to add features as needed, making it highly customizable.\n",
    "Large community and support: Flask has a large developer community with ample resources for learning and problem-solving."
