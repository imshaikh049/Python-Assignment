    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios is it preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",

    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases (NoSQL databases) are designed to store and manage data without the use of fixed schema tables, which is different from traditional relational databases (SQL). They can store data in different formats like key-value pairs, documents, column-based, or graph formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preferred Scenarios for MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "For applications requiring high performance and scalability.\n",
    "When rapid iteration is needed (schema-less design allows for flexibility in data models).\n",
    "For real-time analytics and data streaming use cases.\n",
    "When horizontal scaling (sharding) is required for distributed databases."

    "Schema-less: MongoDB doesn't require a fixed schema for its collections, allowing for flexibility in data structure.\n",
    "Document-Oriented: Data is stored as BSON (Binary JSON) documents, which allows for complex nested data structures.\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling using sharding, which helps distribute data across multiple servers.\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB supports indexes to improve query performance.\n",
    "Replication: Supports replication for high availability using replica sets, ensuring redundancy.\n",
    "Aggregation Framework: Allows for advanced data analysis through its powerful aggregation operations like filtering, grouping, and transforming data.\n",
