    "Q1. What is Abstraction in OOPs? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to the concept of hiding the complex internal implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary parts to the user. It allows users to interact with objects through a well-defined interface, without needing to understand the underlying implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider a Car class. When you drive a car, you don't need to know the internal mechanics like how the engine works or how the gears are shifted. You just use the drive() function."
