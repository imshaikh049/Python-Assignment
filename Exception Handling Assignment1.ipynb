    "Q1. What is an Exception in Python?\n",

    "Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Occur during runtime (while the program is running).\n",

    "They can be handled using try and except blocks.\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Occur at compile time (when the code is being parsed).\n",
    "They are caused by incorrect syntax or code structure, such as missing colons or parentheses.\n",
