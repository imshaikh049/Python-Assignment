    "'a': Append mode. Opens the file for writing, but data is appended to the end of the file if it exists. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "'b': Binary mode. Opens the file in binary mode. Can be combined with other modes, e.g., 'rb' or 'wb'.\n",
    "'x': Exclusive creation. Opens the file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, the operation fails.\n",
