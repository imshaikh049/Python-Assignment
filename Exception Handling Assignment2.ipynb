    "Q1. Why do we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception?\n",
    "In Python, the Exception class is the base class for all exceptions. When you create a custom exception, you need to inherit from the Exception class (or one of its subclasses). This ensures that your custom exception is treated like any other built-in exception and integrates seamlessly with Python’s exception-handling framework. By inheriting from Exception, your custom exception can:\n",

    "Be raised using the raise statement.\n",
